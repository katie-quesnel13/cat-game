- allegiances mode (take in clan.json and format it into clan order, using the present data)
    - this would make a decent core to the looping tool?
- modify namemaker to be able to take in different location packs for prefixes
- think of more prefixes and suffixes + add them in
- some sort of method of pairing cats + chance to have kittens on ageclan
- maybe swap off of the names by coat method? or change it so duplicates are removed after merging the lists
- some sort of looping access system which means i can launch one program and access the others repeatedly
    - maybe change with this to have "save files" rather than always using clan.json
- refactor the existing code to make more sense, especially splitting methods into more generic files
    - this would probably also involve using more efficient solutions than chained if statements, as they're a lot to read
- adjust the data system to have access to determined blue and het as part of the cat data, rather than needing to check
 descriptions for specific wording (currently blue and singular eye)
- add converting the moons ages into years to something. math is hard and computer is good at it
